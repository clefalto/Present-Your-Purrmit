Welcome to your first day on the job! 
As your boss, I'm here to show you the ropes.
In a few seconds, I'm going to pass something to you real quick.
This is, of course, our Meowzkovia permit.
There's a seal on the back and the permit holder's information on the front.
Today, we're only letting feline citizens of Meowskovia enter.
Make sure everyone has unexpired permits, and are vaccinated for Meowlaria.
So since all my papers are legit, please place an Accept stamp on my permit.
Then, pass my permit back to me.
