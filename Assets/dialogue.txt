---TUTORIAL---

Boss Cat:

Welcome to your first day on the job, <name>!
As your boss, I'm here to show you the ropes.
Let me pass something to you real quick.
[passes his purr-mit]
This is, of course, our Meowzkovia permit.
You can tell pretty quickly with the seal on the back and the info down there.
Just make sure the expiry and vaccinations are up to date and you're all good.
[passes his vaccine record]
These vaccine papers are also to make sure the information on the permit is legit.
Finally, you have some stamps on your desk, Accept and Reject.
So since all my papers are legit, please place an Accept stamp on my permit.
Then, pass all my papers back to me.

[player stamps the permit and passes the papers back]

IF THE STAMP IS ACCEPT:
Thank you so much. 
Good luck with the rest of your shift!
[walks away]

IF THE STAMP IS REJECT:
Oh. You accidentally rejected me.
That's okay, you're still learning!
I'm sure you'll get the hang of it soon!
Good luck with the rest of your shift!
[walks away]
